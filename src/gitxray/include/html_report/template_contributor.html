    <h3>Contributor: {{contributor_name}}</h3>
	 <p>This section provides findings on the activity for this specific Contributor within the repository. The data presented here has been gathered through a thorough inspection of the repository's activity, specifically focusing on contributions made by this account. While some of the GitHub APIs used to gather information may return universal or cross-repository data (e.g. such as 90-day activity metrics that cover all of a contributorâ€™s activity across all repositories), most of the findings presented in this report are exclusively tied to their interactions within this particular repository. Put another way; this is focused to this repository; it is NOT a full analysis on the account nor on its interactions with other repositories.</p>
