# Awesome Features &#128171;

Because of the amount of data it analyzes, `gitxray` can be a bit overwhelming at first. Let's look at a few examples of potential awesome findings which can better explain why you're here and why `gitxray` is awesome &hearts;. 

## Unintended disclosures in Contributor profiles &#128064;

`gitxray` reports under a `user_input` category any user-supplied data that repository Contributors may have exposed via their GitHub accounts inadevertently. This is normally the case of PGP and SSH key name fields, which unfortunately are used by Users to record hostnames, computer models, password locations (e.g. in 1Password), or even the _password itself_ to a given key (which we all know might be the same password used elsewhere). To make things more interesting, `gitxray` also identifies any "excess" data found before, or after, PGP Armored keys published in a User's GitHub account. Wondering what that data normally is? Erroneous copy/pastes from the command line while exporting in ASCII/Armored format their keys. And what might that contain? Most of the times, a shell prompt revealing a local username, a hostname and a directory path. May I remind you all of this data is Public-facing.

You may focus specifically on these types of findings by filtering results with:
```py
gitxray -o https://github.com/SampleOrg -v -f user_input
```
or, for a specific repository (remember, _Verbose is always optional_): 
``` py
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -f user_input
```

## Spotting shared, co-owned or fake Contributors &#128123;

Open source projects are under attack, with malicious actors hiding in plain sight. GitHub has [released a Security alert](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/) describing one of potentially many modus-operandi adopted by Threat actors. So why not panic (a bit) and see if there's anything you could do to help protect the repositories you care about?

`gitxray` reports under the `association` category information that could help identify cases of suspicious activity or identity. By fingerprinting Keys added to a profile, as well as those historically used to sign a commit, and by looking at, for example, key and account creation times, it becomes possible to cross-reference the data and link _(hence 'association')_ the behavior to 2 or more accounts.

You can focus specifically on association findings by filtering for `association` with:

``` 
gitxray -o https://github.com/SampleOrg -v -f user_input
```
or targetting a specific Repository with (_Verbose is always optional_):
```
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -f user_input
```

### Important 

Associations MUST NOT be directly and blindly used to report fake or shadow accounts. They are automatic observations from a piece of well-intended code. Do NOT treat association results as findings directly. We must protect open-source projects by first and foremost respecting open-source developers. Ensure that any actions taken are thoughtful and based on solid evidence, not just automated associations. 

## Forensics: What happened on the day of an incident? &#128269;

Because `gitxray` collects data from multiple sources of activity including Commits, Comments, Workflow Runs, Issues, Deployments and more; and because Verbose mode in `gitxray` shows activity in a standarized YYYY-MM-DD format, it becomes possible to use Filtering in order to place focus on specific activity happening at a specific point in time.

For example, by running `gitxray` with the following arguments, only results from that specific date are returned. You may place focus on a day, or even a month:

``` 
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -f 2024-08
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -f 2024-09-01
```

## Untrustworthy Repositories and Activity &#127988;

`gitxray` can be used to protect yourself, your team and your customers from fake Repositories and suspicious activity. For example, by analyzing commit dates and comparing them to the account creation timestamp of contributors, `gitxray` can flag inconsistencies that may indicate:

* Tampered Commits: Some repositories may be manipulated to appear older than they actually are, such as claiming that all commits date back six years when the repository was only created a week ago. This tactic is often used to increase perceived value. Unfortunately, altering commit dates is relatively easy in Git, and GitHub is no exception. More on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/ympce5/is_it_possible_to_change_commit_date/).

* Reclaimed Usernames: Trusted contributors might have had their accounts deleted and then re-registered by malicious actors. GitHub allows a username to be re-released after 90 days, making this a possible attack vector. Learn more about GitHubâ€™s account deletion policy [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/deleting-your-personal-account#deleting-your-personal-account).

Although we always recommend running a full unfiltered verbose X-Ray, it is possible to focus on unreliable historic activity by filtering for Warning keywords:

``` 
gitxray -o https://github.com/SampleOrg -v -f warning
```

## The PR Rejection Awards &#127942; 

Another `gitxray` feature is the ability to list a TOP 3 of GitHub accounts that have tried to submit Pull Requests to the repository, which ended up closed AND NOT merged. In certain emotional scenarios, this could be paraphrased as _rejected PRs_. Kidding aside, in some cases, this could lead to identifying Contributors who have repeatedly failed at merging a very evidently unaligned piece of code to a branch (I know, it sounds unlikely for an account to try and merge backdoor.py repeatedly... but is it?).

`gitxray` will show a TOP 3 list specific to Repository Contributors and a separate list for accounts which are NOT Contributors to the Repository.

These findings, if any exist, are reported under a `contributors` category along with additional information related to other Repository Contributors. You can focus specifically on findings from the contributors category by filtering for `contributors` with:

``` 
gitxray -o https://github.com/SampleOrg -v -f contributors 
```
or targetting a specific Repository with (_Verbose is always optional_):
``` bash
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -f contributors
```
## Fake Stars, Private repos gone Public and more &#128584; 

GitHub shares publicly [up to 90 days of past Events](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/events?apiVersion=2022-11-28) for any User account, which include actions such as Repository creation, Watching, Committing, Pull Requesting, and more. `gitxray` summarizes these events for you and prints them out under a `90d_events` category in the results included for each Contributor, summarized in order to reduce the amount of data listed by default. 

The summary however can be expanded into a full list of Events by merely turning on _Verbose mode_ (the -v flag). Using _Verbose mode_ is convenient in order to get details on **WHAT** was actioned upon.

For example, Events you may come across that would be interesting include:

- A user having very recently _switched a repository from PRIVATE to PUBLIC_. GitHub requires Users to tick several boxes prior to moving an existing private repository to public, lowering the chances of an unintended leak; however, a recent public repository may not have had as much attention and auditing as you would think.

- A user [starring](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/starring?apiVersion=2022-11-28) (originally known as _watching_) too many respositories too rapidly. This could be a tell of an account used for [Stargazing](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/). Or it could just be a normal human being in one of those days filled with anxiety.

- And more!

To find Contributors who recently switched from Private to Public a repository or who have Starred repositories, you may start with:
``` 
gitxray -o https://github.com/SampleOrg -f starred,private
```

And you could then enable _Verbose_ (or before, you decide) and target a specific Repository Contributor to get more information:
``` 
gitxray -r https://github.com/SampleOrg/SampleRepo -v -c some_user
```
