# Vulnerable Workflows

You may have landed here because Git X-Ray suggested that you further inspect a specific Workflow in a repository that you were X-Raying, or because of some other reason.

Either way, here's a list of specialized software and documentation on how to proceed with analyzing the security of your workflow.

# Tools for Workflow analysis
